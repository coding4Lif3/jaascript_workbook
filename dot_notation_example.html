        /* Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation because it is more
         succinct and easier to read. However there are some cases where you have 
         to use brackets. For example, if an object property name is defined at runtime
          then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the 
          name as a variable inside brackets as shown with input below: */

        const person_two = {
            name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
            age: 32
        }

        // if you run that in a web page you can see the difference
        person_two['input'] = prompt('Get name or age?');
        console.log(person_two['input']);
        console.log(person_two.input);
        console.log(person_two.name);

        person_two['eyes'] = 'hazel';

            console.log('Bye everybody!');

        person_two['eyes']
        person_two.farewell()

        // One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set 
        // not only member values dynamically, but member names too.
        // Let's say we wanted users to be able to store custom value types
        // in their people data, by typing the member name and value into two text inputs.
        // We could get those values like this:
